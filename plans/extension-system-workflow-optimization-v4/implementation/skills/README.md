# Skill Implementation Specs

**Note:** For creating Skills, use Anthropic's `skill-creator` skill.

This directory would contain detailed implementation specs, but since `skill-creator` handles Skill creation, we keep it minimal.

## What Goes in a Skill

See [Phase 1](../../phases/phase-1-skills.md) for what each Skill should contain:
- SKILL.md with clear description for auto-activation
- Documentation map pointing to `docs/` files
- Research document references
- Decision trees and checklists
- NO code examples (those are in docs/)

## Skills to Create

1. **ha-integration-structure** - File organization guide
2. **ha-entity-knowledge** - Entity implementation guide
3. **ha-config-flow-knowledge** - Config flow guide
4. **ha-coordinator-knowledge** - DataUpdateCoordinator guide
5. **ha-common-mistakes** - Anti-patterns and quality requirements

See Phase 1 for detailed requirements of each.
